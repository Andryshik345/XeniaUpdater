# XeniaUpdater

(yet another) Xenia Updater with a few extra features.

What it has before its competitors:
- A simple Batch script
- Backups a current version in case if newer build has issues
- Checks if local build is older than on Github and updates only then
- After checking and updating launches the emulator (so you can use it like a shortcut)

[Download](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Andryshik345/XeniaUpdater/main/xenia_updater.bat)

# Install
Just place it next to your current Xenia Canary executable or place it into an empty folder and it will download it.

Feel free to suggest any improvements.
